/// The order of the steps is part of the algorithm: **orders, then fills, then positions, then
/// cash, then fees, then `ReconciliationRun`** (task brief interpretation 12).
///
/// 1. **Open orders, by client order id.** The broker wins: every difference is adopted with
///    `OrderStateChanged` plus a `CompensatingEvent` naming the difference and the corrected event
///    ids. An order the broker has and we do not is external activity (§7.1): every agent on the
///    account goes `exits_only` until the owner acknowledges. A reject naming a `client_order_id`
///    we do not know counts only toward the 403 threshold and is not external activity unless it
///    carries a fill.
/// 2. **Fills since the checkpoint, by fill id.** Every missing one is ingested, as `FillApplied`
///    or, where its order is already terminal, `LateFillApplied`, which itself schedules another
///    reconciliation. Fills are always applied to accounting (§5.7).
/// 3. **Positions**, compared only *after* step 2 — a difference a missing fill explains is not a
///    mismatch, and pausing on it would pause a healthy agent at every restart.
/// 4. **Cash**, within 0.01 × fills since the last broker cash snapshot plus accrued unposted
///    fees. Paper's simulated fees and dividends are excluded from this comparison while staying
///    in P&L and buying power (§10, interpretation 25).
/// 5. **Fees**, exact once posted: a difference alerts and is never silently adjusted.
/// 6. **`ReconciliationRun` last**, appended with `expected_head` equal to
///    [`BrokerSnapshot::taken_at_head`], so an `OrderSubmitted` that landed in between makes the
///    append answer `HeadMismatch` and the run is recomputed against a fresh snapshot rather than
///    published as covering something it never saw (interpretation 15).
///
/// **Adoption is scoped to the order set**, which is the only row §11's on-mismatch column
/// adopts. A position, cash, or fee difference is never written away: writing one away would make
/// the ledger agree with the broker while destroying the evidence that they disagreed
/// (interpretation 13). A mismatch pauses the agents holding the instrument and alerts, and
/// nothing in this crate ever lifts that (interpretation 14).
